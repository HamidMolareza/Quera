## About

All the solutions that are here, get full score (100) in Quera. But that does not necessarily mean the best answer.

## Usage

In Quera, structure of the questions link is as follows: https://quera.org/problemset/{Question-Index-As-Number}/

We solve each question in a separate branch. The name of that branch is the {question index} in Quera link.

For example: To see the solution to problem 280 (https://quera.org/problemset/280), checkout to branch [280](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraProblems/tree/280).

In the master branch, there are codes related to automatic readme generation.

### Documentation

Codes usually do not need additional explanations. We try to make the codes clean, readable and with comments.

In some cases, more explanations are needed, which you can read in the readme file of question branch. for example see [this readme](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraProblems/tree/2551)
