In Quera, structure of the questions link is as follows:
https://quera.org/problemset/{Question-Index-As-Number}/

We solve each question in a separate branch. The name of that branch is the {question index} in Quera link.

For example, to solve question 1234 (https://quera.org/problemset/1234), Checkout to branch 1234, solve the problem, commit and finally send PR.

Thank you :)
