## Development environment setup

If we want to solve a problem with ID [10163](https://quera.org/problemset/10163/) with `C#` language, the structure is
as follows:

- Solutions
    - 10163
        - csharp
            - solution1.cs
            - solution2.cs

## Do you want to improve the solution? Refactor the code?

According to [the mentioned structure](#development-environment-setup), update the codes or documents and send PR.

## A problem has been solved, but do you want to provide another solution?

All the solutions of a language must be placed in a folder called the same language (for example, `csharp`). If you are
not using a new language, do not create a new folder. Use another source file to the previous sources and preferably
update the readme file of the problem.

## The problem is solved, but do you have a solution with a new language?

According to [the mentioned structure](#development-environment-setup), create a folder called the desired language and
put your codes. You can also use
the [default templates](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraProblems/tree/master/Templates).

## Do you want to solve a new problem?

According to [the mentioned structure](#development-environment-setup):

- create a folder named `Quera problem ID`
  in [Solutions](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraProblems/tree/master/Solutions) folder.
- Create a folder in it called the desired language (like `csharp`, `python`, `react`, etc).
- Put your solution there.

You can also use the [default templates](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/QueraProblems/tree/master/Templates).
